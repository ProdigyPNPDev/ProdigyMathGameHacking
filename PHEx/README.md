# Prodigy Hacking Extension (PHEx)

Combined with [P-NP](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/P-NP) to inject modified game files into Prodigy.

Made of the Redirector extension, no-csp, and a little extra spice ;)

## [Usage](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/meta/wiki/QUICKSTART.md)
See our guide: https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/meta/wiki/QUICKSTART.md
<br><br>




## Building

```shell
npm i
npm run build
```

The output will be in `/PHEx/build/`. The generated files are `extension.zip`, `extension.xpi`, and `extension.crx`.
