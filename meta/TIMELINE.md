# Timeline of Prodigy Hacks


### PIXI Ages
`9/21/2019 - 03/25/2020`

During these times, `PIXI.game` was a thing. However, Prodigy hacks were not well known.
<br><br><br>



### Phaser Day
`03/25/2020 - 03/26/2020`
 
On this day, we used `Phaser.GAMES[0]`, only for it to be patched the day after.
<br><br><br>



### Login.gameObj Day
`03/26/20 - 03/27/2020`

An alternative method was found. However, it only supported the player object. It was also patched after a day.
<br><br><br>



### CanvasPool Days
`03/27/20 - 03/30/2020`

This method worked for longer than the last one, however, it was also quickly patched. Three days... that's kinda quick.
<br><br><br>

 

### Cheat Dashboard Day
`03/30/2020 - 03/30/2020`

[A cheat dashboard](https://prodigy-dashboard.hostedposted.com/) was developed by [hostedposted](https://github.com/hostedposted). The dashboard was a good concept, however it became very buggy due to some game updates, which caused it to be unsupported the day after.
<br><br><br>
 


### Dark Ages
`04/01/2020 - 04/07/2020`

The first week of April was a sad week for Prodigy hacks. All known hacking methods were patched. Had the goal of telling [Prodigy](https://prodigy.com) to make better and more secure code been achived? [No](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No). Hacks would be back up and running on `04/07/2020`
<br><br><br>
 
 

### EnableDebug Days
`04/07/2020 - 04/09/2020`

A way to enable debug mode was found, and worked for two days. However, debug was removed by [Prodigy](https://prodigy.com) quickly after.
<br><br><br>



### Prodigy Console Prevention
`04/10/2020`

On this day, [Prodigy](https://prodigy.com) added a [devtool disabler](https://github.com/theajack/disable-devtool), which would cause a [404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) on [devtool](https://wd.imgix.net/image/dPDCek3EhZgLQPGtEG3y0fTn4v82/HaeLqueTSvpXQQXUwUCk.png?auto=format) open.
<br><br><br>
 
 

### Debugger Scope Ages
`04/12/2020 - 04/15/2020`

On these days, multiple variables were used to obtain the [Prodigy's scopes](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/docs/classes/_player_d_.player.md), and access the `instance` objects. This revived free membership hacks.
<br><br><br>
 


### Redirector Ages
`04/15/2020 - 11/13/2020`

After many days, the [Redirector hack](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/P-NP) was created, which would use a modified version of prodigy's game files. This would not be patched for a very long time. It was suceeded by the [PHEx extension](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/tree/master/PHEx).
<br><br><br>




### Content Security Patch
`06/10/2020`

On June 10th, Prodigy added content security headers. This caused the addition of another extension, Anti-CSP, to help with hacks. Having this many extensions for one job was tiring, and later PMGH introduced [PHEx](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/tree/master/PHEx).
<br><br><br>
 


### `hack.instance.prodigy.player` Patch
`07/05/2020 - 07/05/2020`

On July 5th, Prodigy implemented a patch for `hack.instance.prodigy.player`. This was unpatched by PMGH about 3 hours later.
<br><br><br>
 

### Script based hacks return
`08/25/2020`

On August 20th, we found a way to access the [Prodigy API](https://github.com/ProdigyAPI/ProdigyAPIDocs), and use hacks without the [Redirector extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd).
<br><br><br>
 


### `_.instance.prodigy.player` Patch
`09/17/2020 - CURRENT`
On September 18th, Prodigy patched the `hack` variable by redirecting to a 404 page if the `hack` variable was detected. To unpatch this, we renamed the variable to `_`. Prodigy already uses `_`, so they can't delete it.
<br><br><br>
 


### Chrome Extension Releases
`10/21/2020 - 11/11/20`

On October 21st, Google accepted the [PHEx (Prodigy Hacking Extension)](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/tree/master/PHEx) extension submission to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore). The extension works exacatly the same as the Redirector Hack, but is much easier as you only have to install our extension without importing the JSON file into Redirector.
<br><br><br>
 


### Chrome Extension Taken down
`11/11/2020`

On November 11th, [Prodigy](https://prodigy.com) removed the PMGH Chrome extension via [DMCA](https://www.dmca.com/)[ takedown](https://www.dmca.com/Takedowns.aspx). It was back up some day later.
<br><br><br>
 


### Prodigy adds SHA256 Integrity Checks
`11/13/2020 - 11/19/2020`

On November 13th, [Prodigy](https://prodigy.com) added extra security via integrity checking with [SHA256](https://www.n-able.com/blog/sha-256-encryption), breaking the hacks. The SHA256 check still exists, however it was bypassed by [Natsiumi](https://github.com/Patheticmustan) on November 19.
<br><br><br>



### SHA256 Sumchecks bypassed
`11/19/2020`

On November 19th, [Natsumi](https://github.com/Patheticmustan) bypassed the [SHA256 sumcheck](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM), which fixed the hacks.
<br><br><br>



### The end of PMGH
`04/06/2022`

On April 6, 2022, [Prodigy-Hacking/](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking)[ProdigyMathGameHacking](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking) and [Prodigy-Hacking/](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking)[P-NP](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/P-NP) were deleted due to a DMCA takedown. [P-NP](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/P-NP) technically hosts a copy of Prodigy's code, except it's modified to allow the running of hacks. [PHEx](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/tree/master/PHEx/build) was [taken off the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gjabpajagbgoifbkflgojeojmnlmioea).
<br><br><br>



### The rise of ProdigyPNP
`04/07/2022`

Not too late after [Prodigy Hacking Official](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking)'s repositories were taken down by the DMCA, [gemsvid√∏](https://github.com/afkvido), [Eris](https://github.com/Erisfiregamer1), [donaldli2020](https://github.com/donaldli2020), and [Apocalyptic](I forgot your link) came together and formed a new organization called [ProdigyPNP](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP). This organization was dedicated to keeping Prodigy hacks alive, no matter what DMCA comes at us. *bless the demon king that gemsvido had many local clones, also the github fork network is a thing.*
<br><br><br>




### The return of PHEx
`04/16/2022`

After fixing the broken P-NP and PHEx, Prodigy hacks were back up, just like before.
